## Inspiration
### World Maps
Classic fictional and real world maps are probably the most important art resource when designing generated worlds.

### City Maps
City maps are important too, since I intend on building a city generator with my world map generator. The best existing city generator (somewhat recently kind of integrated with Azgaar's work, more of an easter egg really) is by Watabou and covers districts, walls, farms, roads, and rivers.

### Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator
Azgaar has the best (bar none) available map generator that can be run immediately in the browser. His work is current but unfortunately I find it hard to understand a lot of his (JavaScript) code. Nevertheless, his blog discusses in detail the approach he takes to tackling various challenges which makes it not only a fantastic starting point but also great reference material when writing parallel code.

### Amit Patel's Work
Amit has several iterations of his maps, and his oldest ones were done in ActionScript, which originally got me into procedural programming. Amit's site boasts a lot of amazing in-depth tutorials and essays on different programming concepts ranging from pathfinding to his most popular: generating random worlds.
